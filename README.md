#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

**Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.**<br>
Software engineering is the process of creating a high-quality and secure website that meets user needs. <br>It involves stages such as design, development, testing, and maintenance of software.<br> **Importance** <br>It helps in creating bug-free and reliable software. Software engineering involves creating scalable and adaptable software that can
grow with the increase in demand and adapt to changes in technology. As technology advances, 
software engineers play a major role in developing applications such as machine learning and artificial intelligence.
It involves creating innovative solutions that enhance user experience.


**Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.**<br>
-2009: DevOps emerged to enable collaboration between operation and development teams.<br>
-2010: CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery) practices automate code integration, testing,
and deployment processes for quicker and more reliable software delivery.<br>
-2013: Docker was released, driving the adoption of containerization and changing how applications are developed and deployed.<br>

**#List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.**<br>
•	Requirement analysis<br>
In this stage, feedbacks from internal and external stakeholders are obtained. The problems to be solved are identified.<br>
•	Planning<br>
In this stage, we determine what is needed to be done. The plans help the team to understand and estimate cost, benefits, and risk mitigation factors.<br>
•	Architectural/software design<br>
Software designers use the requirements obtained to come up with the best architecture. The most logical software design is chosen for development.<br>
•	Software Development<br>
Developers start to build the product as per the design using programming languages.<br>
•	Testing<br>
Checks and fixes are conducted to ensure the product meets the quality requirements.<br>
•	Deployment<br>
The product is released in phases. The stakeholders test the product and give feedback. Feedback is incorporated into the product, and the final whole product is deployed.<br>


**Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.**<br>
**Similarities**<br>
• Both methodologies are centered around some goals. They are bound by time and cost constraints.<br>
• Both methodologies undergo the same development stages, like planning, designing, developing, testing, and deployment.<br>
• Both involve stakeholders to get feedback to implement their needs and expectations.<br>
• Testing is done in both methodologies to ensure the final product is bug-free and meets quality standards.<br>
**Differences**<br>
• In agile methodology, the user is involved throughout the development phases, while in waterfall, user inputs are required after completing each phase.<br>
• Agile uses an incremental approach, while Waterfall uses a sequential approach.<br>
• In agile, changes can be made at each phase, while the  waterfall model does not allow changes after a phase is completed.<br>
• In agile methodology, testing can be done before the product is complete, while in waterfall, testing is done when the complete product is ready.<br>
• Agile has a  lower development cost compared to the  waterfall model.<br>
**examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.**<br>
• Agile model: A company is creating an e-commerce website. Every two weeks, the product components are released for feedback and review. New features are added.<br>
• Waterfall model: A school creating an E-learning platform. Courses are created in advance. The software is released after it is complete.


**Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.**<br>
**Software developer**<br>
The major roles of software developers are to develop new software or maintain an existing one. Software developers are categorized into front-end, back-end, and full-stack developers.<br>

**Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.**<br>
**Importance of IDE**<br>
IDE combines developer tools like code editor, compiler, and debugger into a graphic user interface to increase the productivity of a developer. This enables developers to build applications without the difficulty of configuring an environment. IDEs are configured for different programming languages, hence providing functionalities and specific features to enhance development. It also helps in Syntax highlighting, code refactoring, and code analysis, boosting overall code quality.<br>
**Examples of IDE**<br>
Microsoft Visual Studio, Eclipse, Netbeans, Pycharm, Android studio, AWS Cloud 9, MySQL Workbench<br>
**Importance of VCS**<br>
A version control system helps the development team to collaborate on a project from anywhere in the world.<br> 
Software development involves different skills. Members work on separate functionalities and features. VCS helps them work on separate branches and merge their work into the main codebase.<br>
It tracks all changes made to the source code and enables reverting them in case of an issue. Tracking changes also makes it easier to debug and review codes.<br>
VSC helps the development team to recover lost code easily in case of system failure.<br>
**Examples of VCS**<br>
Git, Helix Core, Microsoft TFS, Mercurial<br>


**What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.**<br>
**Challenges**<br>
1.	The complexity of the software system makes it difficult for developers to understand and manage all components of the system.<br>
2.	Project managers may underestimate the budget and time for a project, leading to the  submission of codes that do not meet organization standards.<br>
3.	Advancement in technology forces software engineers to adapt to new technologies and programming languages.<br>
4.	Sometimes it is difficult to maintain the quality of the software as developers account for performance, security, and usability.<br>
5.	Changing requirements may make it difficult for developers to plan and manage their work.<br>

**Solutions**<br>
1.	Simplify the software systems using architecture principles and design patterns.<br>
2.	The project manager should track progress and work closely with developers to understand the time taken for a task.<br> 
3.	Software engineers should learn continuously and explore new technologies to stay current.<br>
4.	Ensure software quality by using QA techniques to identify and fix bugs.<br>
5.	Use of flexible and incremental development approaches such as agile and scrum to handle challenging requirements.<br>


**Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.**<br>
**Unit testing**<br>
It is the testing of the smallest functional units of an application at an early development stage.<br>
Importance<br>
Helps to reduce production cost because bugs are identified and fixed at an early stage of the development process. It also helps to verify that each functional unit works as per requirements.<br>
**Integration testing**<br>
It is a type of testing to check the interaction between different components of an application and identify any issues that result from their integration.<br>
Importance<br>
It is essential in complex systems where different units are integrated to ensure the reliability and stability of the system.<br>
It is crucial in ensuring the different components of an application work as intended.<br>

**System Testing**<br>
It is a test after the integration of components to examine the behaviour of a system. It evaluates if the product meets requirements and is ready for deployment.<br>
Importance<br>
It helps to detect bugs that failed to be detected in unit and integration testing and to ensure the system behaves as it should.<br>
**Acceptance Testing**<br>
It is a test conducted before deployment to ensure that the specification requirements are met. End users participate in testing the system.<br>
Importance<br>
Acceptance testing enables the team to know further requirements as it involves end-user testing. The involvement of the user enables the clear description of requirements and builds clients' confidence.<br>


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering<br>


**Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.**<br>
Prompt engineering is the process of training AI models by writing effective prompts to generate better responses.<br>
Importance<br>
It improves the responses of AI models by providing specific instructions and explanations.<br>

**Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.**<br>
Vague prompt: Create a game.<br>
Improved prompt: Create a star collector game using Python. Make it easy to understand.<br>
The improved prompt is effective because it gives specific instructions on what game and what programming language to be used. This gives a better and focused response with clear explanations.<br>
